# Introduction

## Why did we build headless-charts?

There are many terrific graphics libraries out there eg: [Observable plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-gallery). Why build another?

We wanted to build something
- which takes [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) styles as arguments and are easy to integrate within existing pages built with TailwindCSS.
- which behaves purely 'headless'ly like the eponymous [headless-ui](https://headlessui.com) 
- which implements charts as well and try to cover as many charts from [FT-interactive Visual Vocabulary](http://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/) as possible
- which implements behaviour consistently (animations, tooltips etc.)
- which is well documented

D3js is the library we are using to write most of these components.
